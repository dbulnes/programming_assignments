Assignment 2, Aligned Memory Allocation and Freeing README

Created by David Bulnes on 12/15/13

Compiling program and creating an executable:
	>make 
	OR
	>make aligned_memory

Running the program: 
The program takes in three command line arguments and loops aligned memory
allocation, assignment, and freeing twice to show proper freeing of the heap. 
Argument 1: Number of bytes to allocate.
Argument 2: Power of 2 from which to align allocated bytes.
Argument 3: Value to assign to aligned allocated memory.

Example:
    >./aligned_memory 8 8 35 
	*****
	Memory Allocation Attempt #1
	Address of Originally Allocated Memory:
	0x7fb4505038b0
	Address of Aligned Memory:
	0x7fb4505038c0
	Assigning value of 35 to 0x7fb4505038c0
	Value at Address 0x7fb4505038c0 : 35
	Freeing Address 0x7fb4505038c0

	*****
	Memory Allocation Attempt #2
	Address of Originally Allocated Memory:
	0x7fb4505038b0
	Address of Aligned Memory:
	0x7fb4505038c0
	Assigning value of 35 to 0x7fb4505038c0
	Value at Address 0x7fb4505038c0 : 35
	Freeing Address 0x7fb4505038c0
